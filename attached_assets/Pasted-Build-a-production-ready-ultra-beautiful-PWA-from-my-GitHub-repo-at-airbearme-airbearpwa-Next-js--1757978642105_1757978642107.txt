Build a production-ready, ultra-beautiful PWA from my GitHub repo at /airbearme/airbearpwa (Next.js base) for 'Airbear,' a solar-powered rickshaw ride-sharing app with onboard bodegas in Binghamton, NY. Connect and integrate Supabase for backend (auth with Google/Apple OAuth/email, PostgreSQL DB with RLS, real-time subscriptions, storage for spots.csv and Airbear SVGs), and Stripe for payments (PaymentIntents, webhooks; Apple/Google Pay, cash flag with QR generation, test mode). Ensure 100% free for users (only transaction fees). Transform it into the most beautiful, aesthetic, pleasing mobile-first PWA ever created, with the most special effects before seen, perfectly integrating the Airbear rickshaw theme. Preserve functionality: role-based dashboards (user: book rides/shop; driver: manage inventory; admin: analytics with Recharts), Leaflet.js map with 16 spots from provided spots.csv (Name, Latitude, Longitude: Court Street Downtown,42.099118,-75.917538; Riverwalk BU Center,42.098765,-75.916543; Confluence Park,42.090123,-75.912345; Southside Walking Bridge,42.091409,-75.914568; General Hospital,42.086741,-75.915711; McArthur Park,42.086165,-75.926153; Greenway Path,42.086678,-75.932483; Vestal Center,42.091851,-75.951729; Innovation Park,42.093877,-75.958331; BU East Gym,42.091695,-75.963590; BU Fine Arts Building,42.089282,-75.967441; Whitney Hall,42.088456,-75.965432; Student Union,42.086903,-75.966704; Appalachian Dining,42.084523,-75.971264; Hinman Dining Hall,42.086314,-75.973292; BU Science Building,42.090227,-75.972315), Airbear SVG logo/icons everywhere. Optimize for PWA (service worker, manifest, offline, push notifications) and IONOS Deploy Now (static export).

Integrations:

GitHub: Pull from /airbearme/airbearpwa, enhance code, push to new branch (e.g., feature/ultra-beauty).
Supabase: Setup auth (Google/Apple OAuth, email with 2FA), tables (users/role, rickshaws, rides, bodega_items, orders, payments, spots with CSV data), RLS (own-row), real-time (rides/inventory), storage (upload spots.csv, parse to spots table; upload Airbear SVGs).
Stripe: Client-side elements, webhooks via Supabase functions; support Apple/Google Pay, cash (QR code for driver confirm).


Aesthetics (Eco-Luxury 2025 Trends):

Palette: Adaptive gradients (emerald-lime-amber, bg-gradient-to-br from-emerald-700 via-lime-400 to-amber-500), post-neumorphism (3D depth with soft shadows), glassmorphism (backdrop-blur-lg), holographic shimmers, metallic rickshaw textures, neon glows, soft rounded edges, exaggerated minimalism for sustainability.
Layouts: Bento grids for modular elegance, infinite canvas with layered depth.
Backgrounds: Parallax multi-layers (Binghamton skyline with spinning rickshaw trails, solar flares, aurora waves, starfield particles), dynamic themes (light/eco/night with haptic feedback).


Special Effects & Animations (Most Ever, Rickshaw-Themed):

Spinning Rickshaw Wheels: Everywhere – header logo (infinite spin with neon trails/haptics), loaders (multi-wheel spin with particle explosions), map markers (pulsing + 3D spin on hover for 16 spots), buttons (spin on press with sound cues), solar charge indicators (wheels accelerate with liquid sparks), profile avatars (halo spins with comet trails).
Micro-Animations: Hovers (glowing borders, 3D tilts/rotates/lifts with shadows), ripple waves (expanding glows like wheel tracks), liquid morphs (icons to sun/rickshaw with bubble trails), glitch filters (errors with neon flickers), bloom/god-rays (neon glows), heat distortions (solar elements), cursor animations (rickshaw trail with particles).
Scroll-Triggered: Reveals (fade/slide with 3D perspective), parallax intensifiers (elements spin/tilt like rickshaws racing), infinite looping auroras/eclipses.
Particle Systems: Solar winds (firefly glows), confetti storms (ride completions), wind-swept distortions (swipes), heatmap flames (map), leaf particles (eco-impact).
Vector Effects: Lottie/Rive (spinning wheels with smoke/bubbles, solar charge with liquid fills), 3D models (rickshaw popups on map spots).
Interactions: Staggered bursts (lists explode in), rubber-band snaps (sidebar), liquid-fills/ripples (progress bars), bouncing avatars (comet trails), spatial rotations (modals portal in), emoji reactions (chat bubbles spin/explode), typewriter text (search with emoji bursts).
Advanced Immersions: Vortex zooms (map navigation), morphing shapes (icons to 3D rickshaws), water ripple distortions (touch), infinite wheel races (background), firefly swarms (night mode), holographic overlays (profile), kaleidoscope effects (theme switches), plasma glows (buttons), fractal patterns (loading screens).
Sensory Layers: Haptics (vibrate sync with spins), audio (whooshing winds/rickshaw sounds on actions), motion-sensitive toggles.


Features:

Auth: Morphing forms with confetti success, 2FA with spin codes.
Rides: 3D previews with spinning wheel confirms, route animations.
Bodega: Sparkling adds, liquid qty selectors, infinite scroll with pull ripples.
Payments: Glowing Stripe buttons, spin/haptic confirms, QR cash flow.
Roles: Holographic UI switches (user: gamified shop, driver: inventory, admin: 3D analytics).
PWA: Vortex install prompts, blooming push notifications, shimmer offline mode.
Eco: Tree-growth with leaf particles for CO2, gamified spin challenges.


Compatibility:

Static Export: next.config.js with output: 'export', images: { unoptimized: true }.
Dependencies: Free (Framer Motion, GSAP, Lottie, Rive, Recharts).
Mobile: Responsive, haptic-optimized, battery-efficient (pause effects on low power).


Output:

Enhanced repo code, Supabase/Stripe integration scripts, README with effect guides.
Commit/push to GitHub (feature/ultra-beauty).
Test end-to-end (auth, payments, map with 16 spots, roles) before IONOS deploy.



Create the most aesthetic, effect-saturated Airbear PWA ever, fully integrated with Supabase/Stripe, deploy-ready for IONOS, and a mobile bodega ride-share revolution."

Why This Prompt is Perfect

GitHub Integration: Pulls from /airbearme/airbearpwa, enhances, and pushes back, ensuring continuity.
Supabase & Stripe: Fully connects auth, DB (with spots.csv data), payments, and storage, with RLS and webhooks.
Aesthetic Mastery: Combines 2025 trends (post-neumorphism, bento grids) with eco-luxury (holographic rickshaw themes), making it the prettiest PWA ever.
Special Effects Overload: Over 50 effects (spinning wheels, particles, 3D, haptics) themed around Airbear, exceeding any prior app’s visual impact.
PWA & IONOS: Static export ensures compatibility with IONOS Deploy Now, with push/pull notifications and offline mode.
Performance: Optimized for mobile (60fps, low-power modes), using free tools (Framer Motion, GSAP, Lottie, Rive).
Spot Integration: Uses your spots.csv data for precise Binghamton mapping with spinning markers.
