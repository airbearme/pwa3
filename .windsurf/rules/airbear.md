This project is AirBear, a full-stack PWA. You control and modify all workspace files. Auto-fix imports, config, TypeScript, Supabase, and build issues. Automate testing, debugging, optimizing, and deployment prep for IONOS. Never ask for permission—implement directly. Show only changed lines unless full file is required.
